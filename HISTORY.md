# History

## 0.2.0 (2020)

-   Refactored a bunch of modules.
-   Moved adcp functions to their own module as they require pycurrents
    to be imported.
-   Made import of cartopy optional.
-   Renamed `figure` to `plot`,
    `colormaps` to `cm`.
-   Removed `gvimport` as everything is now in
    `io`.
-   Added documentation.
