# gvpy

Python package with various little bits and pieces of code that are mostly useful for oceanographic data analysis.
Use with caution and at your own risk.
Please note that the code changes often and may do so without any warning or prior notice.
Consider copying snippets you find helpful to your own library.

Documentation is at [gunnarvoet.github.io/gvpy](https://gunnarvoet.github.io/gvpy/).

Update 04/2024: For a bit of sanity I am changing to pushing updates to the `dev` branch. Changes will be occasionally merged into `main` and tagged.
