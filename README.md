# gvpy

Python package with various little bits and pieces of code that are mostly
useful for oceanographic data analysis.  Use with caution and at your own risk.
Please note that the code changes often and may do so without any warning or
prior notice.  Consider copying snippets you find helpful to your own library.

Documentation is at [gunnarvoet.net/gvpy](https://gunnarvoet.github.io/gvpy/).

Update 04/2024: For a bit of sanity I am now pushing small updates to the
`dev` branch. Changes are occasionally merged into `main` and tagged. If you
really want to install the package please consider installing a [tagged version](https://github.com/gunnarvoet/gvpy/tags).
For example, to install the June 2025 version of gvpy using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):
```sh
uv add git+https://github.com/gunnarvoet/gvpy --tag v2025.06
```
